The instructor is approachable, and always willing to clarify doubts and provide additional guidance when needed. The course's pace is a bit slow but allows for a deep dive into the subject matter without feeling rushed. The regular assignments helped to stay on track. Additionally, the course materials, including video classes, also help us to clear any doubts regarding any topics. I am fully satisfied with my Python-Ai add-on course experience till now. It has helped me develop my skills and knowledge in Python, and look forward to completing the course and applying what I have learned in practical projects. I would rate this course provided by COZMEK a 4.8 out of 5 and will recommend this course to anyone interested in mastering Python-Ai.",
